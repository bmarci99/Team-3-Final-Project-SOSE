# Poll_Database_Command Line Interface (CLI)
This Project is about Poll & Database Creation in CLI (with Python)


This CLI application allows users to create poll questions with predetermined answers (either text or yes/no). Once created users can select a question and respond to it. The CLI will store the responses and the user then can find out how everyone responded by percentages.
